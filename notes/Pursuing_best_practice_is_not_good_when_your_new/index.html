<p>Don't try to apply professional principles, try out things then learn from your mistakes.
When trying to apply professional principles when new to a subject it prevent experimenting.</p>
<p>We are pushed to &quot;don't even try unless you know the answer.&quot;
We want to be right and scared that everyone think of us as fool.
That's why we try to apply every pro principles when learning.</p>
<p>&quot;Skills in a thing are an outcome of regular practice over time.&quot;</p>
