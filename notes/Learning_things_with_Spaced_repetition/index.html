        <h1>[[Learning things with Spaced repetition]]</h1>
<p>I was looking into one of my Obsidian plugin documentation</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation">A great introduction to flashcard creation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">A cool interactive comic about how your memory work and the concept of spaced repetition</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To get the most out of spaced repetition you must make you cards Small, connected and meaningful.</p>
<p>Small because too much info on a card is bad for learning.
Connected to pictures, sounds, context, and/or personal details!
But most importantly meaningful by making sure your learning is in service of doing something you care about.</p>
