        <p>Computer Networking is the study, creation and maintenance of networks.
These networks are made of interconnected devices.
The devices communicate with one another to share data over the network.</p>
<p>Switches, routers and access points form the core strucure of most networks.
End-devices are then connected so that users could interact with the network.
The devices can be connected in a variety of topologies.</p>
<p>To identify a device on the network, a communication protocol must be set.
Internet Protocol (IP) is the protocol used for relaying data over a network.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am currently learning some crucial skills and knowledge about Networking.
And that's because I need them in order to attend to the courses of this year.
That's why I created <a href="/notes/networking_learning_plan/">a learning plan</a>.</p>
