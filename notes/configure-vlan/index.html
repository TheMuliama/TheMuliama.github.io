        <p>A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a way to create 2 different LAN virtually using a single switch.
Different VLAN in the same network are by default isolated from each others.
VLAN are useful in order to create partitioned broadcast domains, increase traffic and make the network more secure.</p>
<p>Thanks to VLAN it's possible to group hosts that aren't physically connected to same switch.</p>
