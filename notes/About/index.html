        <p>This <a href="Digital_Gard">Digital Garden</a> was build around my own interest.
There is pages about what I found inspiring or interesting.
Everything is a work in progress.
I am still learning everyday.</p>
<p>I do not claim to be an expert at any field I talk about here.
Don't forget that I can be wrong and I have the right to.
However if you see something not true or you have a critique tell me.
You can also chit-chat with me by mail if you want to. (I would be happy)</p>
<p>Here is my mail <code>themuliama[at]proton[dot]me</code>.</p>
<p>Have a nice day :D</p>
