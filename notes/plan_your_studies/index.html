<h2>Don't do cramming!</h2>
<p>Doing a big session just before an exam is not a good idea. If your goal is to retain informations for a long period of time then cramming will be useless.</p>
<p>A single big session won't help with using that information in the future or in your life. Although it can help for an immediate test. So feel free to cram before a test, but don't do only that.</p>
<h2>Make a lot of small sessions</h2>
<p>Don't plan one big session, do a lot of smaller session over the courses of multiple weeks before the exam. It will help you to retain more informations and it will also help with long-term memory. That is called spaced practice.</p>
<p>You will naturally forget some material as time goes on. But forgetting is totally normal! Spaced practice actually help to slow down the amount of things you forget over time.</p>
<p>Dividing your session will also reduce your stress. That's because you will avoid the stress caused by last-minute cramming sessions.</p>
<h2>How to plan your sessions</h2>
<p>Try to plan all of your sessions in advance. Create a schedule and actually try to stick to it. If you weren't able to do a session, it's alright, just redo your schedule.</p>
<p>Use an expanding learning schedule. While you plan your sessions, make the gap between each session bigger and bigger as you do more of them. For exemple the gap between the first session and the second session might be 2 days, then the gap for the next session might be 4 days, then 8, etc.</p>
<p>Create an habit for your sessions. Try to do it everyday. Even if it's only for 10 minutes during the launch break. Don't beat yourself up to stick to it, just do your best. Use the strategy from <em>Atomic Habits</em>.</p>

<p>[!warning]
Spaced practice help you know <strong>when to practice</strong> not <strong>how to practice</strong>. Combine this strategy with studying strategies.</p>
