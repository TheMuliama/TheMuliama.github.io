<h2>1.2 Network Components</h2>
<h3>Host Roles</h3>
<p>All device connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as host. Host are devices that are assigned an Internet Protocole (IP) adress.
the IP address identify the host and the network it's connected to.</p>
<h3>Peer-to-Peer</h3>
<p>A network configuration where the two end devices are directely connected together and have to act as Host and Servers.</p>
<p><em>The advantages of peer-to-peer networking:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to set up</li>
<li>Less complex</li>
<li>Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required</li>
<li>Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No centralized administration</li>
<li>Not as secure</li>
<li>Not scalable</li>
<li>All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance</li>
</ul>
<h3>End Devices</h3>
<h3>Intermediary Devices</h3>
<h3>Network Media</h3>
<h2>1.8 Network Security</h2>
<h3>Security Threats</h3>
<p>Network security must consider environnement, tools and requirements of network while allowing quality of services expected from it.</p>
<p>There is external threats and internal threats. External comes from the internet while internal come from devices in the network.</p>
<p>External threats can include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses</strong> - malicious software or code running on a user device</li>
<li><strong>Spyware and adware</strong> - software which are installed on a device to secretly collects information about the user.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-day attacks</strong> - Also called zero-hour attacks, occur on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known</li>
<li><strong>Threat actor attacks</strong> - A malicious person attacks user devices or network resources</li>
<li><strong>Denial of service attacks</strong> - These attacks slow or crash applications and processes on a network device</li>
<li><strong>Data interception and theft</strong> - This attack captures private information from an organizationâ€™s network</li>
<li><strong>Identity theft</strong> - This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order to access private data</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal threats need to not be underestimated, since the BYOD strat is becoming popular.</p>
<h3>Security Solutions</h3>
<p>One solution is not enough to protect from all threats. Multiples ones should be used.</p>
<p>Basic solutions for homes and small office networks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antivirus and antispyware</strong> - Applications that help to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall filtering</strong> - Blocks unauthorized access into and out of the network. Could be a host-based firewall system that prevents unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security solutions for corporations include the above and the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated firewall systems</strong> - Provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Access control lists (ACL)</strong> - These further filter access and traffic forwarding based on IP addresses and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)</strong> - These identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual private networks (VPN)</strong> - These provide secure access into an organization for remote workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study of network security threats and mitigation techniques starts with a clear understanding of the network structure.</p>
