<h2>How To build good habits</h2>
<p>To build a good habit, you have to ask yourself 4 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to make it obvious?</li>
<li>How to make it attractive?</li>
<li>How to make it easy?</li>
<li>How to make it satisfying?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What identity do you want to build?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Decide the type of person you want to be.</li>
<li>Prove it to yourself with small wins.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Habit scorecard
To be aware of my current habit, to know what habit to remove and what to add. The goal being to go in the direction of the desired identity.</li>
<li>Tracking
Once again, to make it obvious that I am going forward. But also to make it satisfying to be able to repeat the habit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The first basic changes</h3>
<p>Focus on a limited number of good habits to make sure that they happen</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flashcards :</strong> To read at least 10 flashcards everyday and to add at least 3 new one each day.</li>
<li><strong>Sport :</strong> To do a physical activity everyday for at least 2 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Workbout :</strong> At least one workbout of 25 min each day.</li>
</ul>
