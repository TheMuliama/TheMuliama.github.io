    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Happiness is made up of two part.
A happy person feel positive emotions.
They also are satisfied with how they progress toward their life goals.
It can be resumed like so: <em>Happiness is how you are satisfied in your life and with your life</em>.</p>
<p>Happiness is something that seems hard to grasp.
It seem like something no one can't get voluntary.
Many think that there isn't any action we can do to be happier.
But that is a lie that our mind is telling us.</p>
<p>Our mind tend to <a href="/notes/Misconceptions_and_Lies_about_happiness/">tell us lies about what will make us happy</a>.
But that mean that we can work our way through happiness.
And there is an entire podcast about that named The Happiness Lab Podcast.</p>
