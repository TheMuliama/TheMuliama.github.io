        <p>itch.io is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games. It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created.
As a seller you’re in charge of how it’s done: you set the price, you run sales, and you design your pages.</p>
<p>itch.io is also a collection of some of the most unique, interesting, and independent creations you'll find on the web. We're not your typical digital storefront, with a wide range of both paid and free content, we encourage you to look around and see what you find.</p>
<p>Their primary goal is to create a platform that really support the creators it host.</p>
<h2>Open revenue sharing</h2>
<p>Since March 2015, itch.io has an open revenue sharing model. Sellers can now apply the &quot;pay what you want&quot; model towards itch.io: the revenue split between the seller and itch.io is configurable by the seller. You can set it to 10%, 30%, or even 0%.</p>

<h2>Hosting a game jam</h2>
<p>Itch.io can make you host a game jam which is really cool. Imagine hosting a game jam but... like <strong>for a custom hardware or an old console</strong>! For example the <a href="https://play.date/">playdate</a> or the Nintendo ds?</p>
