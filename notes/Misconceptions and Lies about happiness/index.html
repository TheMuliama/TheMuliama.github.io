    <main>
        <p>Our mind is bad at predicting what will make us happy.</p>
<p>There are things that we all want that doesn't really makes us happy.
Like for example wealth, work goals or getting your dream job won't make you as happy as you think.</p>
<p>Also, focusing only on yourself is a recipe for misery and physical health problems.
The quality of relationships matters a lot for happiness.</p>
