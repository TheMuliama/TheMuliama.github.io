    <main>
        <p>I want to prepare my happiness project. I need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Choose my monthly goals</li>
<li>[ ] Sets some resolutions for each goal</li>
<li>[ ] Find a way to track those resolutions</li>
<li>[ ] Come up with my commandements and my secrets of Adulthood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay the monthly goals of Gretchen Rubin are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>January: Boost Energy - Vitality</li>
<li>February: Remember Love - Marriage</li>
<li>March: Aim Higher - Work</li>
<li>April: Lighten up - Parenthood</li>
<li>May: Be Serious About Play - Leisure</li>
<li>June: Make Time for Friends - Frendship</li>
<li>July: Buy Some Happiness - Money</li>
<li>August: Contemplate the Heavens - Eternity</li>
<li>September: Pursue a Passion - Books</li>
<li>October: Pay Attention - Mindfulness</li>
<li>November: Keep a Contented Heart - Attitude</li>
<li>December: Boot Camp Perfect - Happiness</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to come up with my own goals.
I will use the goals from the book.
Except for Marriage, Parenthood and maybe change the meaning of money.</p>
