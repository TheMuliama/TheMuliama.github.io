        <h1>[[Getting stared with Cisco Packet Tracer]]</h1>
<h2>Presentation of the app</h2>
<p>Cisco packet Tracer is an app that can let you explore the vast world or networking. It's a virtual lab that let you practice networking, IoT and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Let you create and explore your own virtual network, configure devices and follow how data packets travel. It can help you practice your network configuration and troubleshooting skills using your desktop or laptop computer. It allows you to simulate networks without having access to physical equipment.</p>
<p>This app have multiple modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulation mode</li>
<li>Physical mode</li>
</ul>
<p>In physical mode you can learn to use virtual rack mount and cable equipement to simulate setting up a network irl</p>
<h2>The Cisco Packet Tracer Interface</h2>
<p>Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. It provides three main menus that you can use for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add devices and connect them via cables or wireless</li>
<li>Select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network</li>
<li>Manage your network</li>
</ul>
<p>The network management menu lets you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open an existing/sample network</li>
<li>Save your current network</li>
<li>Modify your user profile or your preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>CPT (Cisco Packet Tracer) offer a different sample files you can explore to understand different devices and protocoles.</p>
<p>Packet Tracer also provides a variety of tabs for device configuration including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical</li>
<li>Config</li>
<li>CLI</li>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Services</li>
</ul>
<p>The tabs that are shown depend on the device you are currently configuring.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Tab</strong></p>
<p>The Physical tab provides an interface for interacting with the device including powering it on or off or installing different modules, such as a wireless network interface card (NIC).</p>
<p><strong>Config Tab</strong></p>
<p>For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two ways to access device configurations. Configurations can be accessed via a Config tab, which is a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you don't know how to use the command line interface, this tab offer a way to configure basic settings.</p>
<p>Note that this tab is unique to CPT and does not exist in irl networks.</p>
<p><strong>CLI Tab</strong></p>
<p>The CLI tab provides access to the command line interface of a Cisco device. Using the CLI tab requires knowledge of device configuration with IOS. Here, you can practice configuring Cisco devices at the command line. CLI configuration is a necessary skill for more advanced networking implementations.</p>
<p>Note: Any commands that were entered from the Config tab are also shown in the CLI tab.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Tab</strong></p>
<p>For some end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a web browser, and other applications.</p>
<p><strong>Services Tab</strong></p>
<p>A server has all of the functions of a host with the addition of one more tab, the Services tab. This tab allows a server to be configured with common server processes such as HTTP, DHCP, DNS, or other services, as shown in the figure.</p>
<h2>The PPTA activities</h2>
<p>The PTTA hint system will support you as you learn.
When doing a PPTA activity, be sure to read the background and scenario section. Or else it would be difficult to understand the goal of the activity and learn from it.</p>
<p>There is a hint system that you can toggle at anytime. Thanks to the PPTA activities, you can be walked through a new tech or a thing you never did</p>
<h2>Device connections types</h2>
<p><strong>Automatic connection cable</strong>
Simply let the program choose whatever cable it think is the best between two devices.</p>
<p><strong>Console cable</strong>
Can help connect a PC to the router in order to manage the router.</p>
<p><strong>Copper straight-through</strong>
The general rule say that you have to use these cables for unalike devices.
<strong>Copper cross-over</strong>
The general rule is two alike devices use a cross over cable.</p>
